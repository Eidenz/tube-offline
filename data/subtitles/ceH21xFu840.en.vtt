"Hine's the only one who doesn't know

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.471
You should tell her yourself"

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.559
"A house needs a sturdy foundation to withstand the elements..."

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.526
"We're almost ready to eat, you two

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:25.727
I made your favorite stew for dinner"

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:27.304
"Yay!"

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.346
"It's almost dinner time

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:33.553
Let's call it a day"

00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:35.878
"Look, Mavuika!"

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:40.366
"You were supposed to be listening to me!"

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:44.010
"Don't be mad, sis

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:45.759
It's a bookmark!

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.569
To save our place. Hee-hee, till next time!"

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.661
"C'mon, let's go eat

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.529
I have something to tell you"

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.618
"You're gonna head five hundred years in the future..."

00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:07.620
"You're just gonna... You're just gonna die?"

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:10.382
"I'll come find you one day!"

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.833
"I know I can't live that long

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.018
But I'll think of something!"

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.589
"There has to be a way for us to meet again one day!"

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.831
"I couldn't find anything about Hine"

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:25.545
"I'm sorry

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.091
I'm sure she lived a happy life

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.517
If uneventful in the end"

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:33.134
"...Mm"

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.361
"This book belonged to someone who helped my family a super long time ago

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:59.186
We kept it safe for you"

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:07.776
"There's a bunch of old designs inside...

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:09.989
Dunno what they're for"

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.848
"Thank you

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.041
This means a lot to me"

00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:29.388
"Why don't I walk you home?

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:31.822
I'd like to thank your family too"

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.085
"By the way

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.468
Do you like stew?"

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:43.080
"Huh? Oh... It... It's my favorite!"
